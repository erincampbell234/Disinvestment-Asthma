# Disinvestment-Asthma
Public repository for neighborhood disinvestment and asthma work.

In these files, there are additional analyses, figures, and explorations that do not appear in the current drafts of the manuscript. 

In particular, there are two datasets developed in "Dataframe Development." Default data refers to our initial exposure assignment strategy for census tracts which overlapped with more than one HOLC district. The Default assignment assumes the worse HOLC grade when more than one HOLC district intersects a census tract. Alternate refers to our second and prefered exposure assignment strategy. The "Alternate" dataset is what we used to create the final results in current drafts of the manuscript. The "Alternate" assignment assumes the better HOLC grade when more than one HOLC district intersects with a census tract. We argue that the positive-lending impact of a neighborhood recieving a better HOLC grade may overshadow the negative-lending impact of a neighborhood recieving a worse HOLC grade. 

Dataframe Development: Contains all data wrangling from public, raw datasets, to the datasets used in our analyses.

Table 1: Contains a script producing descriptive statistics.

Table 2 and 3: Contains a script producing national (table 2) and city-by-city (table 3) models and statistics.

Figure 1: Creates sample maps of select cities.

Figure 2: Creates national map showing city-by-city model results and statistics.
